# Network Management: CLI vs SDN

This project compares traditional Command-Line Interface (CLI) based network configuration with modern Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller-based management using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 📘 Overview

- CLI-based device configuration
- SDN-based centralized control via PT-Controller
- Comparative analysis on efficiency, scalability, and usability

## 🖥️ Components Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Routers: 3x ISR4331
- Switches: LAN & Backbone
- PT-Controller
- End-user PCs

## 🧪 Features Demonstrated

- Static & dynamic routing
- Fault-tolerant mesh topology
- Centralized SDN configuration
- CLI command walkthrough

## 🔐 Default Credentials

- Username: `cisco`
- Password: `cisco123!`
